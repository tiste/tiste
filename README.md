### I am Baptiste Lecocq

I help people and teams to define and meet their needs. I achieve this by working for and with these people by setting up an environment that promotes exchanges and technical excellence. I consider succeeding in this mission by following indicators related to customer satisfaction and software quality.

My experience in the web in very diverse missions, convinced me that the fluidity of communication and a well designed code are necessary to the success of a project.

I mainly master the languages and frameworks of the Javascript world. I am also involved in a number of methods related to agility and software craftsmanship to grow the teams I support.
